Tableau Extension Library
=========================

Overview
--------
Welcome to the Tableau Extension Library for Anvil applications. This is a Python wrapper for the `Tableau Javascript API <https://tableau.github.io/extensions-api/docs/trex_examples.html>`_. 

- If you're new to Tableau extensions in general, consider viewing the :doc:`whatisthis` document. 

- If you're familiar with Tableau extensions and want to dive in to the Python library, head to the :doc:`getting_started` document for a short tour. 

- If you're here to dive into the details, the more technical documentation can be found in the :doc:`reference/index` section.


Installation
------------

To get started building Tableau extensions with Anvil, add the ``Tableau Extension (Service-Based)`` dependency to your app and import it into your Anvil code using:

.. code-block:: python

    from tableau_extension.api import get_dashboard
